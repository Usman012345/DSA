Artificial Intelligence,CS361,"This course introduces representations, techniques, and architectures used to build applied systems and to
account for intelligence from a computational point of view. This course also explores applications of rule
chaining, heuristic search, logic, constraint propagation, constrained search, and other problem-solving paradigms. In addition, it covers applications of decision trees, KNN, Naive Bayes Classifivation, neural nets, and other learning paradigms.",None,None,None,None,None,None

Data Structures and Algorithms,CS-261,"The course introduces the theory of complexity and abstract data structures as basic building blocks to structure problem objects for efficient solution. This course will cover the basic approaches and mindsets for analyzing and designing algorithms and data structures into two parts. Topics include the following: Worst and average case analysis. Recurrences and asymptotic. Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and selection. Data structures: linked list, stack, queue, binary search trees, heaps, hash tables. Basic Algorithm design techniques such as divide and conquer etc. Algorithms for fundamental graph problems: minimum-cost spanning tree, connected components, topological sort, and shortest paths.",Apply appropriate algorithms to use in specific applications,Analyze time and space complexities of data structures and algorithms,"Understand the fundamentals data structures such as lists, queues, trees, etc.",None,3.

Final Year Project(2020),CSE-491,The main objective of the final year project is to provide students with a design experience in setting solution to real-life model required in society or related industry. These projects are related to field of Computer Science and Engineering. The final year Project will be completed over 2 semesters typically Fall and Spring and coded as FYP I and FYP II respectively.,None,None,None,None,None,None
